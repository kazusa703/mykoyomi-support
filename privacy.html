        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="date">Last updated: February 12, 2026</p>

        <p>MYKOYOMI ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Personal Data:</strong> MYKOYOMI does not collect any personally identifiable information. We do not require account creation, and we do not ask for your name, email address, or phone number.</p>
        <p><strong>Habit Data:</strong> All habit tracking data (habit names, check-in dates, year records) is stored locally on your device and optionally synced via Apple's iCloud service. This data is never sent to our servers.</p>
        <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We do not collect analytics or usage data directly.</p>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>MYKOYOMI uses the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> We display advertisements through Google AdMob. Google may collect certain data for the purpose of serving personalized ads. You can opt out of personalized advertising through your device settings. For more information, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple iCloud:</strong> If enabled, your habit data is synced across your devices using Apple's CloudKit service. This data is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Apple StoreKit:</strong> In-app purchases are processed through Apple's App Store. Purchase data is governed by Apple's Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Advertising</h2>
        <p>MYKOYOMI displays banner advertisements through Google AdMob. You can remove all advertisements by making a one-time in-app purchase. We use Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework to request your permission before tracking your activity across other companies' apps and websites for advertising purposes.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All your habit data is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. If iCloud sync is enabled, data is also stored in your personal iCloud account. We do not have access to your iCloud data. We do not operate any servers that store your personal data.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>MYKOYOMI does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. The app is suitable for all ages as it is a habit tracking tool with no social features.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can delete all your data at any time by deleting the app from your device. If you have iCloud sync enabled, you can also delete your data from iCloud through your device's Settings > Apple ID > iCloud > Manage Storage.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.</p>
